# Customer Churn Prediction
 The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning (leaving) a business or service. Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses across various industries, as it enables proactive measures to retain valuable customers, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer satisfaction.
