# Customer Churn Prediction
 The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning (leaving) a business or service. Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses across various industries, as it enables proactive measures to retain valuable customers, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer satisfaction.

 # Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project



This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom service provider. Customer churn refers to customers discontinuing their subscription or service, and predicting it is crucial for businesses to take proactive actions to retain valuable customers.

In this project, we have used the "Telecom Customer Churn" dataset and performed the following tasks:

1. Data Exploration using Pandas:
   - Loaded and inspected the "Telecom Customer Churn" dataset using Pandas to understand its structure and content.
   - Checked for missing values, data types, and basic statistics of the dataset.
   - Explored the distribution of features and the target variable (churn).

2. Data Visualization using Matplotlib:
   - Created various data visualizations, such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots, to gain insights into the data.
   - Visualized the distribution of numerical features and the relationship between features and churn.

3. Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding:
   - Applied label encoding to convert categorical features with ordinal relationships into numerical format.
   - Utilized one-hot encoding to handle nominal categorical features, converting them into binary vectors.

4. Scaling:
   - Scaled numerical features using standardization to bring them to a common scale.
   - Ensured that features with different scales do not dominate the modeling process.

5. Model Preparation using TensorFlow:
   - Imported the TensorFlow library to build and train an artificial neural network (ANN) model.
   - Preprocessed the data for ANN input, including feature scaling and encoding.
   - Designed the ANN architecture with appropriate layers and activation functions.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Trained the ANN model on the training data.
   - Evaluated the model's performance on the testing data, using relevant evaluation metrics.
